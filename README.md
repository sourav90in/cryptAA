Cryptarithmetic Puzzles

A cryptarithmetic puzzle is a mathematical game where the digits of some numbers are represented by letters (or symbols). Each letter represents a unique digit. The goal is to find the digits such that a given mathematical equation is verified:

      CP +  IS +  FUN =   TRUE

One assignment of letters to digits yields the following equation:

      23 + 74 + 968 =   1065

This CryptaArithmetic solver solves the input SEND+MORE=MONEY but the input string can be modified to solve for any input.
